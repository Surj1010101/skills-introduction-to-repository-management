# Mergington High School Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
At Mergington High, we take the security of our Extra-Curricular Activities website seriously, especially
since it contains student information. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not** create an issue on this repo, disclose the vulnerability publicly, or discuss it with other teachers/students.
2. In the top navigation of this repository, click the **Security** tab.
3. In the top right, click the **Report a vulnerability** button.
4. Fill out the form. It will ask for:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact on student data or site functionality
   - Suggested fix (optional)
5. Email the IT Club faculty advisor at **techsupport@mergingtonhigh.example.edu** and let them know you submitted a report (but **do not** include details).

## Response Timeline
- Acknowledge receipt within 2 school days
- Initial assessment within 5 school days
- Critical issues fixed immediately in a private fork (you‚Äôll be invited to follow progress)

## Thank You
Your responsible disclosure helps keep our school community safe! üôè
